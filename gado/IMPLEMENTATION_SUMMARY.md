2. **Five New Instructions Added**
   - `create_smart_wallet_inheritance` - Set up inheritance with multiple heirs
   - `deposit_to_smart_wallet` - Store SOL in PDA wallets
   - `deposit_tokens_to_smart_wallet` - Store SPL tokens in PDA wallets
   - `update_smart_wallet_activity` - Reset inactivity timers
   - `execute_inheritance` - Automatic asset distribution to heirs

3. **PDA-Based Asset Management**
   - Smart Wallet PDA for configuration storage
   - Asset PDA for secure SOL and token storage
   - Deterministic address generation for predictable interactions

4. **Multi-Heir Distribution System**
   - Percentage-based allocation (must sum to 100%)
   - Support for up to 10 heirs per Smart Wallet
   - Atomic distribution ensuring complete asset transfer

### TypeScript Client Library

1. **SmartWalletClient Class**
   - Complete TypeScript interface for all Smart Wallet operations
   - PDA address calculation utilities
   - Balance checking and status monitoring
   - Activity management and inheritance execution

2. **Developer Tools**
   - Comprehensive test suite demonstrating all features
   - Keeper bot implementation for automated monitoring
   - Demo script showing system capabilities
   - Detailed documentation and examples

### Keeper Bot System

1. **InheritanceKeeperBot Class**
   - Automated monitoring of Smart Wallet inactivity
   - Configurable monitoring intervals
   - Automatic inheritance execution when conditions are met
   - Error handling and retry logic

2. **Production-Ready Features**
   - Multi-wallet monitoring capabilities
   - Detailed logging for transparency
   - Asset distribution verification
   - Scalable architecture for large-scale deployment

## 🎯 Key Features Delivered

### 1. Dual Inheritance Models
- **Escrow Model**: Individual asset escrows with manual claiming
- **Smart Wallet Model**: PDA wallets with automatic distribution
- **Seamless Coexistence**: Both models work side-by-side

### 2. Advanced Asset Management
- **SOL Storage**: Direct lamport transfers to PDA wallets
- **SPL Token Support**: Associated token accounts for PDA storage
- **Balance Monitoring**: Real-time asset tracking capabilities
- **Secure Storage**: Program-derived addresses prevent unauthorized access

### 3. Intelligent Activity Tracking
- **Configurable Inactivity Periods**: From seconds to years
- **Automatic Activity Updates**: On any Smart Wallet interaction
- **Precise Timestamp Management**: Unix timestamp-based tracking
- **Inheritance Eligibility**: Only execute when truly inactive

### 4. Automated Inheritance Execution
- **Keeper Bot System**: Automated monitoring and execution
- **Percentage-Based Distribution**: Precise allocation to multiple heirs
- **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing inheritance execution
- **Transparency**: Complete distribution logging

## 🔒 Security Features

### Access Control
- Only wallet owners can create and manage Smart Wallets
- Only designated keeper bots can execute inheritance
- Heir allocation validation (must sum to 100%)
- PDA-based asset protection

### Inactivity Validation
- Configurable minimum inactivity periods
- Activity timestamp verification before execution
- Multiple methods to reset activity timers
- Prevents premature inheritance execution

### Asset Protection
- Assets stored in secure program-derived addresses
- No partial inheritance executions allowed
- Complete asset distribution or transaction failure
- Owner activity resets prevent accidental execution

## 📈 Production Readiness

### Scalability Features
- Support for up to 10 heirs per Smart Wallet
- Efficient PDA storage and lookup
- Batch processing capabilities for keeper bots
- Optimized instruction execution

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Comprehensive error codes for debugging
- Detailed program logs for troubleshooting
- Keeper bot health monitoring
- Asset distribution verification

### Integration Capabilities
- TypeScript SDK for easy frontend integration
- RESTful patterns for web application development
- Webhook-ready keeper bot notifications
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Smart Wallet Setup
```typescript
// Create Smart Wallet with heirs
const heirs = [
  { heirPubkey: heir1.publicKey, allocationPercentage: 60 },
  { heirPubkey: heir2.publicKey, allocationPercentage: 40 }
];

await client.createSmartWalletInheritance(owner, heirs, 365 * 24 * 60 * 60);

// Deposit assets
await client.depositToSmartWallet(owner, 1.0); // 1 SOL
await client.depositTokensToSmartWallet(owner, tokenMint, 1000000);

// Update activity
await client.updateSmartWalletActivity(owner);
```

### Keeper Bot Deployment
```typescript
// Set up keeper bot
const keeperBot = new InheritanceKeeperBot(program, connection, keeperWallet);

// Monitor wallets
const ownerAddresses = [owner1.publicKey, owner2.publicKey];
await keeperBot.runContinuous(ownerAddresses, 60); // Check every hour
```
