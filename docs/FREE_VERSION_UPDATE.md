# Smart Wallet Free Version Duration Update

## Changes Made

Updated the GadaWallet smart wallet system to change the free version inactivity period from **365 days** to **2 days** for easier testing.

### Files Modified:

#### 1. Smart Contract (`gado/programs/gado/src/lib.rs`)
- Changed `INACTIVITY_PERIOD_SECONDS` from `365 * 24 * 60 * 60` to `2 * 24 * 60 * 60`
- Updated comment from "365 days" to "2 days (for testing)"

#### 2. Frontend Components

**SmartWalletManager.tsx:**
- Changed default `inactivityDays` state from `365` to `2`
- Updated `DEFAULT_INACTIVITY_SECONDS` from `365 * 24 * 60 * 60` to `2 * 24 * 60 * 60`
- Updated tracking analytics from `365` to `2` days
- Changed UI text "Free: 365 days only" to "Free: 2 days only"
- Updated placeholder from "365" to "2"
- Updated help text from "Free users use 365 days" to "Free users use 2 days"
- Updated warning message from "fixed 365-day inactivity period" to "fixed 2-day inactivity period"

**InheritanceManager.tsx:**
- Changed default `inactivityDays` state from `'365'` to `'2'`
- Updated form reset to use `'2'` instead of `'365'`
- Changed placeholder from "e.g. 365" to "e.g. 2"

**ClaimAssets.tsx:**
- Updated fallback inactivity period from `365 * 24 * 60 * 60` to `2 * 24 * 60 * 60` (both occurrences)

#### 3. Demo/Test Files

**smart-wallet-demo.js:**
- Updated `INACTIVITY_PERIOD_SECONDS` from `365 * 24 * 60 * 60` to `2 * 24 * 60 * 60`
- Updated comment from "365 days for free users" to "2 days for free users"

## Impact

### For Testing:
- ✅ **Much faster testing cycles** - inheritance claims can now be tested after just 2 days instead of waiting 365 days
- ✅ **Easier development** - developers can quickly test the full inheritance flow
- ✅ **Better user experience during demos** - showcasing the platform is now practical

### For Users:
- ✅ **Free users** now have a 2-day inactivity period instead of 365 days
- ✅ **Premium users** can still set custom periods (1-3650 days)
- ✅ **All UI elements** properly reflect the new 2-day default

## Verification

Both smart contract and frontend build successfully:
- ✅ Smart contract compiles without errors (`anchor build`)
- ✅ Frontend builds without errors (`npm run build`)
- ✅ All TypeScript types are correct
- ✅ All UI text is consistent with the new 2-day period

## Usage

After deploying the updated smart contract:
1. Free users creating new Smart Wallets will automatically get a 2-day inactivity period
2. The UI will show "2 days" as the default for free accounts
3. Testing inheritance claims becomes much more practical
4. Premium users can still customize their inactivity periods as needed

## Rollback

To revert back to 365 days, simply change all instances of `2 * 24 * 60 * 60` back to `365 * 24 * 60 * 60` and update UI text accordingly.
