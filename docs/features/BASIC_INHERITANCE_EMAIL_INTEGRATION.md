```

### Security Features:
- ✅ **Cryptographically secure tokens** (256-bit)
- ✅ **Expiration dates** (90 days)
- ✅ **One-time use** (marked as used after claim)
- ✅ **Wallet validation** (must use designated heir wallet)
- ✅ **On-chain verification** (inheritance must be actually claimable)

## 🔄 Technical Implementation

### Data Storage (Demo):
```typescript

  type: 'sol' | 'token';
  heirAddress: string;
  ownerAddress: string;
  amount: string;
