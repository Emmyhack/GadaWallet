# 🚀 GadaWallet Complete Setup & Troubleshooting Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide ensures your GadaWallet works perfectly for any new wallet connection and heir creation. We've implemented comprehensive fixes for all known issues.

## ✅ What We Fixed

### 1. **Wallet Connection Issues**
- ✅ **Multiple RPC Endpoints**: Auto-fallback between Solana, Helius, and Alchemy RPCs
- ✅ **Connection Resilience**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Network Health Monitoring**: Real-time RPC testing and switching

### 2. **Blockhash Validation Problems**
- ✅ **Enhanced Retry Logic**: Up to 5 attempts with fresh blockhashes
- ✅ **Smart Error Detection**: Identifies and handles network-specific errors
- ✅ **Progressive Backoff**: Intelligent delay scaling (2s, 4s, 6s, 8s)

### 3. **Platform Setup Automation**
- ✅ **Auto-Detection**: Checks platform and profile status automatically
- ✅ **Guided Setup**: Step-by-step initialization with clear instructions
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Handles "already exists" errors gracefully

### 4. **Inheritance Management**
- ✅ **Pre-flight Validation**: Checks all requirements before transactions
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- ✅ **Account Verification**: Ensures user profiles exist before heir creation

## 🔧 New Enhanced Components

### 1. **useWalletConnection Hook**
```typescript
// Robust wallet connection with multi-RPC support
const { 
  connected, 
  program, 
  connection,
  switchRpcEndpoint, 
  testRpcConnection,
  executeTransaction 
} = useWalletConnection();
```

### 2. **usePlatformSetup Hook**
```typescript
// Automated platform initialization
const { 
  isReady, 
  needsPlatformInit, 
  needsUserProfile,
  initializePlatform, 
  createUserProfile 
} = usePlatformSetup();
```

### 3. **useInheritanceManager Hook**
```typescript
// Enhanced heir management with validation
const { 
  addSolHeir, 
  addTokenHeir, 
  checkHeirExists,
  validateHeirData 
} = useInheritanceManager();
```

### 4. **EnhancedInheritanceManager Component**
- Real-time validation with error feedback
- Network status monitoring with RPC switching
- Guided setup flow with progress indicators
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

Run our comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Test everything automatically
node comprehensive-test.js

# Expected output:
# 🎯 Overall Score: 6/6 (100.0%)
# 🎉 EXCELLENT! Your GadaWallet setup is working perfectly!
```

## 🛠️ Manual Testing Checklist

### For New Wallets:

1. **Connect Fresh Wallet**
   ```
   ✅ Use a wallet that has never connected to GadaWallet
   ✅ Ensure you're on Solana Devnet
   ✅ Get some SOL from faucet: https://faucet.solana.com
   ```

2. **Platform Setup (Automatic)**
   ```
   ✅ Platform initialization should prompt automatically
   ✅ User profile creation should be guided
   ✅ Both should complete without "blockhash" errors
   ```

3. **Add SOL Heir**
   ```
   ✅ Enter heir wallet address (different from yours)
   ✅ Set amount (e.g., 0.1 SOL)
   ✅ Set inactivity period (minimum 1 day)
   ✅ Transaction should complete successfully
   ```

4. **Add Token Heir (Optional)**
   ```
   ✅ Enter token mint address
   ✅ Set token amount
   ✅ Transaction should complete successfully
   ```

## 🔍 Network Debug Tools

Use the built-in debug tools in the Enhanced Inheritance Manager:

1. **Test Network Button**: Checks current RPC health and speed
2. **Switch RPC Button**: Cycles through available endpoints
3. **Current RPC Indicator**: Shows which endpoint is active

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Wallet not connected"
**Solution**: Ensure wallet adapter is properly configured and wallet is approved

### Issue: "Platform must be initialized first"  
**Solution**: Use the automatic platform initialization in the UI

### Issue: "User profile not found"
**Solution**: Create user profile using the guided setup

### Issue: "Blockhash is invalid"
**Solution**: 
- Use the "Switch RPC" button
- The system will automatically retry with fresh blockhashes
- Try during different times of day (devnet can be congested)

### Issue: "Heir already exists"
**Solution**: This is expected behavior - each owner/heir pair can only have one inheritance setup

### Issue: "Insufficient funds"
**Solution**: Get more SOL from the devnet faucet
